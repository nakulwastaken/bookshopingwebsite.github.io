Who says you can't run away from your problems?<br>
 You are a failed novelist about to turn fifty.<br>

 A wedding invitation arrives in the mail:<br>
 your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged <br>
to someone else. You can't say yes--it would be too awkward<br>
--and you can't say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk<br>
 are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around<br>
 the world.
