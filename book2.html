<b>Phoenix Poets</b><br>
How can a person come to understand wars and hatreds well enough to explain them<br>
 truthfully to a child? The Bower engages this timeless and thorny question through<br>
 a recounting of the poet-speaker’s year in Belfast, Northern Ireland, with her young daughter.<br>
 The speaker immerses herself in the history of Irish politics—including the sectarian conflict<br>
 known as The Troubles—and gathers stories of a painful, divisive past from museum exhibits,<br>
 newspapers, neighbors, friends, local musicians, and cabbies. Quietly meditative, brooding,<br>
 and heart-wrenching, these poems place intimate moments between mother and daughter alongside<br>
 images of nationalistic violence and the angers that underlie our daily interactions.<br>
 A deep dive into sectarianism and forgiveness, this timely and nuanced book examines the many<br>
 ways we are all implicated in the impulse to “protect our own” and asks how we manage the histories that divide us.<br>
