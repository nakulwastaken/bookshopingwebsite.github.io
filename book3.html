<h5>A Village with My Name: A Family History of China's Opening to the World</h5><br><br> 
When journalist Scott Tong moved to Shanghai, his assignment was to start<br>
 the first full-time China bureau for “Marketplace,” the daily business and<br>
 economics program on public radio stations across the United States.<br>
 But for Tong the move became much more—it offered the opportunity to <br>
reconnect with members of his extended family who had remained in China after<br>
 his parents fled the communists six decades prior. By uncovering the stories<br>
 of his family’s history, Tong discovered a new way to understand the defining<br>
 moments of modern China and its long, interrupted quest to go global.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
A Village with My Name offers a unique perspective on the transitions in China<br>
 through the eyes of regular people who have witnessed such epochal events as<br> 
the toppling of the Qing monarchy, Japan’s occupation during World War II
