For readers of Schindler's List, The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz<br>
 and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas comes a heart-breaking story of <br>
the very best of humanity in the very worst of circumstances. <br>
I tattooed a number on her arm. She tattooed her name on my heart.<br>
 In 1942, Lale Sokolov arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was given <br>
the job of tattooing the prisoners marked for survival - scratching numbers<br>
 into his fellow victims' arms in indelible ink to create what would become one<br>
 of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust. Waiting in line to be tattooed, <br>
terrified and shaking, was a young girl. For Lale - a dandy, a jack-the-lad, <br>
a bit of a chancer - it was love at first sight. And he was determined not only<br>
 to survive himself, but to ensure this woman, Gita, did, too. So begins one of the<br>
 most life-affirming, courageous, unforgettable and human stories of the Holocaust:<br>
 the love story of the tattooist of Auschwitz. ----- 'Extraordinary - moving, confronting<br>
 and uplifting . . . I recommend it unreservedly' Greame Simsion 'A moving and ultimately<br>
 uplifting story of love, loyalties and friendship amidst the horrors of war . <br>
